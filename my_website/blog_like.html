                    it’s having the courage to show up and be seen when 
                    we have no control over the outcome.</p>

                    Sooner or later we must ask whether this law meets the test of relativistic invariance. 
                    We shall postpone until Chapter 5 a thorough discussion of this important question. 
                    But the answer is that it does, and not merely in the sense that the statement above holds in any given inertial frame, 
                    but in the stronger sense that observers in different frames, measuring the charge, obtain the same number. In other words, 
                    the total electric charge of an isolated system is a relativistically invariant number.
